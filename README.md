### About

This project came about in July / August of 2020 as a new version for the aging French vACC website. The goal of this project is to build a fully new front- and backend interface and logic for our division, with one key goal: simplicity and efficiency.

This website features both a 'guest' landing area, as well as an authenticated member dashboard, available to anyone with a vatsim account.
The website is also fully integrated with the vACC Discord server, <a href="https://www.vatsim.fr/discord" target="_blank">which you may join by clicking here</a>.

### Dependencies

This project's dependencies can be found in the `composer.json` and `package.json` root files.
It is based on the Laravel Framework, and uses a Bootstrap 4 & *mostly* vanilla JS & CSS frontend, with no additional frontend frameworks to note. Future versions might use one, such as Vue (but that's for the future...).
